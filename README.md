github-starred
================

Keep track of github starred repos


#### Goals

Query github starred repos by user.  I often find myself interested in
so many github projects, I star ones I want to come back to.  I want to
be able to have a concise view of all my starred repos with descriptions.
Possible extensions would be to group by language or something else
(like "web" or "device drivers").



TODO
- pagination
- topic tags
- something interesting with the view :)
